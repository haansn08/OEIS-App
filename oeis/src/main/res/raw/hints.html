    <li><strong>Enter about 6 terms, starting with the second term.</strong><br>
        Leave off the first term or two, because people may disagree about where
        the sequence begins.<br>

            <li>If every other term is zero (e.g.
                1 0 2 0 4 0 8 0 16 0 32 0 64 0 ...), omit these zeros,
                and look up 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 instead.</li>
            <li>If your sequence has an obvious common factor
                (e.g. 2 6 12 20 30 42 ...) try dividing it out
                and look up 1 3 6 10 15 21 instead.</li>
